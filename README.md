# airline-reservation-system
This project is a console-based Airline Reservation System written in the C programming language. It allows users to:

View available flights

Book a seat on a flight

Cancel a booking

View current bookings

It simulates how a basic airline ticketing system works and helps understand the use of arrays, structures, loops, conditional logic, and menu-driven programs in C.

This is an ideal beginner-level project to practice data management, user interaction, and function modularity in C.
